# Qknn_algo

The Qknn algorithm is an algorithm presented in [MkV_control_problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00445), and based on local regression (k-nearest neighbors) and quantization theory, to solve control problems.

In this repertory, some implementations of Qknn are available to solve some of the stochastic control problems proposed in [MkV_control_problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00445). The grids for the quantization of the normal distribution are available in http://www.quantize.maths-fi.com/

* SystemicRiskSmoothc.jl is the code, written in Julia, using quantization and k-nearest neighbors to solve a Systemic Risk problem proposed in [MkV_control_problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00445).
* portfolioLiquidation_github.jl is the code, written in Julia, using quantization and k-nearest neighbors to solve a portfolio liquidation problem proposed in [MkV_control_problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00445).
