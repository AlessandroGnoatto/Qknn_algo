# Qknn_algo

In this repertory, some implementations of the Qknn algorithm, presented in [AlgoTrading](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01446), are available to solve some of the stochastic control problems proposed in [MkV_control_problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00445).

* SystemicRiskSmoothc.jl is the code, written in Julia, for the Systemic Risk problem proposed in [MkV_control_problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00445).
